Hi, can you see this?

Oh, hi there! Thanks for coming by. 
If you can see this post now, that probably means my website is finally working... and I am finally willing to show it to the world. Not sure how long it'd take me to finish it up, but I'll keep going at it! :)

Here are a few credits to those who helped me accomplish this:
<li>Thanks to [Victor Lai](http://www.laivictor.com/) for helping me with the technical stuff and giving me motivation! </li>
<li>Thanks to [Michael Chang](http://blog.azuresky.ca/) for buying (stealing) my domain name! :P </li>
<li>Thanks to [Roy Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ruoyu-wang/88/767/b41) for taking 99.9% of the pictures you see on this website! </li>

And of course, thanks to Google, StackOverflow and Github for making it happen. If you want to see a more beautiful side of my website, aka. the code, click [here](https://github.com/Sally-Yang-Jing-Ou/Sally-Yang-Jing-Ou.github.io)
