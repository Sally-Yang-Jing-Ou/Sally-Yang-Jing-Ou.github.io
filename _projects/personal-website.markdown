HELLO THERE! MY SITE IS FINALLY ALIVE! <br> Thanks for dropping by! I have finally managed to some the time to complete and re-polish my website. It has truly been a fun experience :)!

Of course, my website is still incredibly NOT mobile-friendly, but I promise I will re-construct the website during Christmas (2014-2015, this coming co-op work term).

I've been working on this site since July 2014, it has taken quite amount of blood and tears to get me here, nevertheless, I've enjoyed everything and I learned (and still am learning) a lot :) And maybe, when I have more time, I'll re-write all these posts with better descriptions.

My thoughts are like stars right now I can't fathom into constellations, as it is getting very late at night... So I am going to end this post with a few credits:
<li>Thanks to [Victor Lai](http://www.laivictor.com/) for helping me with the technical stuff and giving me motivation! </li>
<li>Thanks to [Michael Chang](http://blog.azuresky.ca/) for buying (stealing) my domain name! :P </li>
<li>Thanks to [Roy Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ruoyu-wang/88/767/b41) for taking 99.9% of the pictures you see on this website! </li>

And of course, thanks to Google, StackOverflow and Github for making it happen. If you want to see a more beautiful side of my website, aka. the code, click [here](https://github.com/Sally-Yang-Jing-Ou/Sally-Yang-Jing-Ou.github.io)

And oh, any comments/suggestions are welcome!!! :)
