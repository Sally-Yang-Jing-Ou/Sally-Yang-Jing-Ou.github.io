This is a hack I did at the [Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com/). We had 4 people in a team, other team members were [Jason Loo](http://nosajool.github.io/), [David Fu](http://dvdfu.me/), and [David Dong](https://github.com/c9dong).

This is an online multiplayer [word-guessing game](http://wordasm.herokuapp.com/) developed in a group for the Hack the North hackathon. Players log in using Facebook to play rapid consecutive games, competing to list words from scrambled letters.

Enough with the BS, click [here](http://wordasm.herokuapp.com/) to play. <br>To view the source code, click [here](https://github.com/Nosajool/Wordasm).

We had 36 hours at this hackathon, which started on September 19th, 2014 and ended on September 21st, 2014. Our team originally planned to make an Android app, the idea was great and we thought we had everything under control. 
<br>It turned out that, we spent almost 5 hours just to get setup, to download the Android SDK and whatnot, and another 5 hours to try to figure out what to do next. Long story short, we ditched Android and moved on to this Web app. Best decision ever, why didn't we do this earlier?!

The first screenshot here shows the original and somewhat complete version of our Web app, each player is color coded in a different color, as you can see, the correct words that are printed on the screen are not color coded, so it was hard to tell who guessed the correct words.

The next few screenshots show you the complete (somewhat) version of our Web app, this is the version we used at demo. The colors are working fine now (we literally hacked in this feature 15 mins before our demo). Scores will be added once we have time.

In general, this was one of the best experience/hackathons ever (minus the crappy food tho).
